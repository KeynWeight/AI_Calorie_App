# Food Data Central MCP Server

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides seamless integration with
the [USDA's FoodData Central API](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide) for enhanced nutrition data in the Calorie App.

## Features

- 🔍 **Smart Food Search**: Advanced search capabilities in the USDA FoodData Central database
- 🧪 **Detailed Nutrition Data**: Comprehensive nutrient profiles with vitamins, minerals, and macros
- 📄 **Paginated Results**: Efficient handling of large datasets with configurable page sizes
- 📊 **Multiple Data Types**: Support for Foundation, SR Legacy, Survey (FNDDS), and Branded foods
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Optimized API calls with intelligent caching
- 🔧 **Easy Integration**: Seamless MCP protocol integration with the main Calorie App

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Running the Server

The server uses stdio transport, which means it's designed to be run as a subprocess by an MCP client. To run it directly:

```bash
# Set the USDA API key as an environment variable
export USDA_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
npm start
```

For development with hot reloading:

```bash
# Set the USDA API key as an environment variable
export USDA_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
npm run dev
```

## Using with Claude Desktop

To use this MCP server with Claude Desktop:

1. Open the Claude Desktop settings:

   - On macOS: Click on the Claude menu and select "Settings..."
   - On Windows: Click on the Claude menu and select "Settings..."

2. In the Settings pane, click on "Developer" in the left-hand bar, and then click on "Edit Config"

3. This will create or open a configuration file at:

   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

4. Add the Food Data Central MCP server to the configuration file:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "food-data-central": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["tsx", "/path/to/food-data-central-mcp-server/src/index.ts"],
         "env": {
           "PATH": "/opt/homebrew/bin",
           "USDA_API_KEY": "<INSERT KEY HERE>"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/food-data-central-mcp-server` with the absolute path to this repository, and `<INSERT KEY HERE>` with your actual USDA API key.

   Note: If you're on Windows, you may need to adjust the PATH value to include your npm global installation directory.

5. Save the configuration file and restart Claude Desktop

6. After restarting, you should see a hammer icon in the bottom right corner of the input box. Click on it to see the available tools.

Now Claude will be able to access the Food Data Central API through this MCP server. You can ask Claude to search for foods, get nutrient information, or retrieve detailed food data.

## Integration with Calorie App

This MCP server is specifically designed to work with the main Calorie App to provide enhanced USDA nutrition data. When enabled, it allows the app to:

- **🎯 Accurate Matching**: AI-powered ingredient matching against official USDA database
- **📊 Enhanced Nutrition**: Replace estimated values with precise government data
- **🧪 Micronutrients**: Access to detailed vitamin and mineral information
- **🏛️ Official Source**: Use authoritative nutrition data from USDA FoodData Central

The server integrates seamlessly with the app's workflow and is activated during the USDA Enhancement stage.
